Dinky Little Calculator

Copyright(c) 2019 Neal Miskin
All Rights Reserved.

This is a dinky little calculatior I made using CodeBlocks and wxWidgets.
It's my first attempt to make a GUI application.
There isn't too much else to say, what you see is what you get. 

I don't have a proper license file yet, but there's nothing here worth stealing.
If you find any of the code useful for any non-commercial purposes go ahead and use it.
If you want any of this for commercial purposes, you probably need to hire a better coding team ;-)
